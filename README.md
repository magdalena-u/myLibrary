# Odin Project - Library

Project from the Odin Project
small Library app

I've created basic library app. You can add book, which you've already read or you are going to read. 
There is no possibility to storage data yet, but I would like to improve this app. I'm going to add some elements in the future like:
storage data, rate of book etc.
